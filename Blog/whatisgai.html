            What is Generative AI? A Comprehensive Guide for Everyone
        </header>

        <p>
        At first glance, generative AI looks like pure magic. But once you start to peel back the layers behind this fascinating technology, you see it for what it is: a statistical process with both impressive results and critical limitations.
            <br><br>
            In its broadest sense, generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates novel content based on patterns learned from existing data. Perhaps the most obvious example of generative AI is predictive search. Google trains a large language model (LLM) on billions of search queries made by users over the years, which then tries to predict the next word in your own search query.
            <br><br>
            But predictive search is old school, even primitive, compared to recent advancements in generative AI. Generative AI can now be used to write everything from new Seinfeld episodes to scholarly articles, synthesize images based on text prompts, and even produce songs in the likeness of famous artists.
            <br><br>
            Despite the hype, there is cause for concern. Chatbots powered by generative AI can produce inaccurate and toxic responses, deepfake videos of politicians and public figures can be used for spreading disinformation, and models of any kind can be used to reinforce existing human biases.
            <br><br>
            It’s clear that generative AI will impact labor, industry, government, and even what it means to be human. In order to coexist with generative AI, we need to understand how it works and the risks it poses. This article will explain what a machine learning model is, discuss the difference between discriminative and generative models, explore some real-world applications of generative models, and touch on their risks and limitations.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Machine learning models</h2>
            <br><br>
            Artificial intelligence is a broad term that describes a piece of technology that can perform tasks that mimic human intelligence, such as those requiring reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, or language understanding.
            <br><br>
            Machine learning is a branch of AI in which “machines” (algorithms) “learn” patterns and associations from data in order to perform specific tasks. This is how it works:
            <br><br>
            <ol class="list">
            <li>
            Define the task. The first thing we need to do is define the task that we want the model to perform. This could be classifying an incoming email as spam or not spam, predicting future revenue based on sales data, assigning customers to different groups based on their behavior, recommending new products for customers based on their purchasing history, or creating an image based on a given text prompt.
            <br><br></li><li>
            Select the model. There are many different factors that influence which type of model we want to choose. The task we defined in the previous step, along with the nature and amount of available data, and how the model will be used in the real world (and by whom) all influence the type of model we want to use.
            <br><br></li><li>
            Collect (and clean) the data. Next, we collect data that we want our model to learn from. We clean it up by deleting outliers and corrupted data and organize it in a tabular format.
            <br><br></li><li>
            Optional: Split the data. When learning from data, we often set aside a chunk (usually 80%) to build our knowledge, which is known as the training data. We then use the remaining portion (typically 20%), which is called the validation data, to check how well we've learned. This process helps us see if our understanding of the training data holds up against new information.
            <br><br></li><li>
            Train the model. Next, we take our empty model and tell it to learn as much as it can from the training data. This is called the training process because the model is being trained (i.e. it's learning, studying, and analyzing the relationships in the data). We can give a model a little guidance and nudge it in certain directions by choosing parameters for the model.
            <br><br></li><li>
            Evaluate the model. Before releasing the model into the wild, we want to get an idea of how well it performs by seeing how it scores on certain metrics, like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. If we have a validation set, we can ask the model to perform the chosen task on the validation set and see how accurate it is.
            <br><br></li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            Machine learning is an intricate, iterative, and ever-evolving process. Most interest is centered on the model training step, but most time is actually spent on the data collection and cleaning step. Just as fossil fuels like oil and natural gas are sent from one location to the other through an intricate series of pipelines, data has its own set of pipelines as well. Once pipelines are up and running, they need constant monitoring and maintenance, but getting to that point takes a tremendous amount of work.
            <br><br>
            However, for the purpose of this article, we're going to focus on the machine learning models themselves. In order to effectively understand generative AI, we must understand the difference between generative and discriminative machine learning models.
        </p>
        <h2>Discriminative models vs. generative models</h2>
        <p>
            The job of a model is to use these associations and patterns learned from a dataset to predict outcomes on other data points. These predictions come in the form of probabilities between 0 and 1. And because probability is a measure of uncertainty, and there is always some degree of uncertainty present in real-world situations, predicted probabilities can never be equal to exact 0 or 1.
            <br><br>
            Machine learning models vary in the methods they generate predicted probabilities for data points. In the context of generative AI, it’s important to understand the distinctions between how discriminative models and generative models generate these predicted probabilities.
        </p>
        <h2>Discriminative models</h2>
        <i>Discriminative models learn to predict probabilities for data based on recognizing the differences between groups or categories based on examples they've seen before.
        </i>
        <p>
            For instance, a logistic regression model can predict the probability of a binary outcome, such as the probability of a student passing a class based on features like attendance rate, hours spent studying, previous exam scores, and the pass/fail status of past students.
            <br><br>
            Consider the illustration below, where each point is visualized as an individual student from the previous year with its own attendance rate, study time, previous exam scores, and final pass/fail status. Given the individual features and final outcomes for each student, the model draws a decision boundary.
        </p>

        <h2>Generative Models</h2>
        <i>Generative models learn to predict probabilities for data based on learning the underlying structure of the input data alone.</i>
        <p>Generative models are so insanely good at studying and learning from the training data that they don't need labeled outcome data, like in the example above. This means two things:

            <ol class="list">
                <li>Generative models can predict probabilities for data (like discriminative models, but just using a different method).</li>
                <li>Generative models can generate new data that looks very similar to data it's seen before (the training data).</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>  Consider the task of figuring out whether an Amazon review for a product is generally positive or negative. In the illustration below, each point is visualized as an individual review, with its own style, tone, and unique combination of words and phrases. A generative model studies all these data points, capturing the patterns, structure, and variations in language for each review as well as their relationships to each other.</p>
        <img src="./Resources/generative model.png" >
        <p>
            Given all of the words and patterns in all of the reviews, a generative model calculates the probability of those words and patterns occurring in a positive review versus a negative review. This probability is called the joint probability and is defined as the probability of a set of features occurring together in the data. For instance, the model may learn that words like "broken" and "disappointed" occur frequently together within negative reviews while words like "highly recommend" and "very satisfied" occur frequently together in positive reviews.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, the model will apply all the knowledge it has learned from the training data to determine the likelihood of new, unseen reviews being classified as either positive or negative. What sets generative models apart from discriminative models is the fact that they can perform classification tasks as well as generate completely new data, when prompted. This means that our Amazon review model can classify existing reviews as well as write new reviews.
            <br><br>
            When working on a generative task, a model needs to be prompted. In this case, a model that has already been trained on reviews is fed a prompt of text and is asked to guess which words come next.
            <br><br>

        <h2>Generative AI in the real world</h2>
        <p>
            Generative models have been used in machine learning since its inception, to model and predict data. However, more recent advancements in the field, such as the emergence of variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN) models in 2014, have propelled generative technology to new heights, enabling models to synthesize completely novel images. Likewise, the introduction of the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model in 2017, marked a significant leap in language generation capabilities, leading to a succession of continuously improved language models capable of generating text indistinguishable from human-written text to the naked eye.
            <br><br>
            While major tech companies like Meta and Google have long invested in AI research and are constantly trying to one-up each other with each large language model they release, the startup world has also seen an explosion of interest in exploring the potential of AI, particularly generative models. Generative AI startups have collectively raised more than $17 billion in funding according to Dealroom, which maintains an excellent up-to-date visual landscape of funding in the field.
            <br><br>
            Let's take a look at how some of these companies are leveraging AI through products that generate text, images, and audio.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>Accuracy & harmful content</h2>
        <p>
            Another concern regarding the implementation of generative models is model accuracy. LLMs have the tendency to hallucinate, which means that they provide false information in a totally convincing manner. These hallucinations have the potential to disseminate misinformation on a global scale and can undermine public trust in AI systems. Because open source models generally undergo less stringent (if any) post-model alignment processes, they are especially at risk of "going off the rails," and going further than simply hallucinating; they produce downright harmful content. In March 2023, the National Eating Disorders Association shut down its human-operated telephone hotline and replaced it with a chatbot that ended up giving problematic weight loss advice to a psychologist independently testing the bot after it went live.

        <h2>
            Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
        In this article, we've discussed the key aspects of generative machine learning models, particularly their capacity to differentiate between various data types and to create new data that closely resembles existing data. The quality of generative models has increased dramatically in the last decade, leading to an explosion of investment in the companies and technologies behind generative AI, namely in regard to generative text, images, and audio.
        <br><br>
        However, with this rise also come ethical concerns such as data privacy, model accuracy, and creating harmful content. We must continue to monitor these issues and practice personal vigilance and awareness when using generative AI products.
